###Asymetrical Encryption

please note that I haven't yet included a script to calculate the public and private keys, because its a pain to do. I might or might not do it in the future. Therefore, all numerical values are valid keys that have been calculated by hand, so if you want it to work please don't touch these unless you know what you're doing. I have left the two test examples at the end, please feel free to remove them from the code if it bothers you.
